# bottrell/learning_flutter

I'll be using this repository to share code between my two development environments as I follow along with the "Learn Flutter and Dart to build iOS and Android Apps (2022)" video course by Max Schwarzmuller. 

I'll be documenting my progress on my Medium site in my "100 Days of Flutter" blog series:
